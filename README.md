# hurricanes

This project looks at hurricane data to determine if the femininity level of hurricane name is associated with more deaths. 

I perform an exploratory data analysis as well as fit poisson and negative binomial regression models to the data. I conclude that femininity level of hurricane name and deaths from hurricanes are not related based on the models developed. This topic is important because if in fact feminine hurricane names are deadlier due to an unconscious, there should be policies to address this. Solutions might be to issue public service announcements about the severity of hurricanes, regardless of the name, and/or to change the naming conventions of hurricanes. 

The final report can be seen [here](documentation/hurricanes_report.pdf).
